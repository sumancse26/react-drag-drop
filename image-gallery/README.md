# React Image Gallery with Drag-and-Drop Swap

This project demonstrates an image gallery in React where users can drag and drop images to **swap** their positions within the gallery. This functionality is achieved using the HTML5 drag-and-drop API in conjunction with React's state management.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag images and drop them onto other images, swapping their positions.
- **React State Management**: The image gallery is powered by React's `useState` to manage and update the image order.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: This project uses vanilla React without external drag-and-drop libraries, keeping it simple and lightweight.
